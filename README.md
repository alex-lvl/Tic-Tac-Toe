# Tic Tac Toe

### Overview    
A Tic Tac Toe App created with HTML/CSS and Javascript.

### Features
Users may choose between two game modes, 2 player or ai mode. Also, before starting a game, users may add their name. Once a round has ended, the user may reset the gameboard by clicking the reset button. The current AI mode is unsophisticated and makes a random legal play. Creating a sophisticated AI with the minimax algorithm is a work in progress. 

### Objectives
